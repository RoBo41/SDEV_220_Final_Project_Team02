# SDEV_220_Final_Project_Team02
Created this using PyQt5 so make sure you have that installed before running.
When running this project you will want the main, userLogin, Newestlogin files.
Run the Newestlogin file to start the application correctly. 

This is a personal expense tracker allows you to login to the app using a name and pw or your choice.
It allows for the user to add, edit, clear, and plot their expenses in a table/graph. 
The user can use the file menu to export their data to a CSV file where they can name and save it to keep track of different spending times.
